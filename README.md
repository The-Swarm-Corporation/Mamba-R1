Mamba R1 represents a novel architecture that combines the efficiency of Mamba's state space models with the scalability of Mixture of Experts (MoE). This implementation achieves superior performance through reduced memory usage and increased token processing capabilities compared to traditional transformer architectures, while maintaining model quality through selective expert routing.

## Installation

```bash
pip install mamba-r1
```

## Usage

```python
from loguru import logger
import torch

from mamba_r1.model import create_mamba_moe


def main():
    # Set up logging
    logger.add("mamba_moe.log", rotation="500 MB")

    # Model parameters
    batch_size = 4
    seq_length = 512
    dim = 256  # Smaller dimension for example purposes

    # Create model with smaller parameters for testing
    logger.info("Initializing MambaMoE model...")
    model = create_mamba_moe(
        dim=dim,
        depth=6,  # 6 layers for this example
        d_state=16,  # Smaller state dimension
        d_conv=2,  # Smaller conv dimension
        expand=1,  # No expansion
        num_experts=4,  # 4 experts per layer
        expert_dim=512,  # Smaller expert dimension
        max_seq_len=2048,
    )

    device = torch.device("cuda:0")
    logger.info(f"Model device: {device}")

    # Create example input (batch_size, seq_length, dim)
    logger.info("Creating example input...")
    x = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_length, dim).to(device)

    # Optional attention mask (1 = attend, 0 = ignore)
    mask = torch.ones(batch_size, seq_length).bool().to(device)

    # Set model to evaluation mode
    model.eval()

    # Forward pass
    logger.info("Running forward pass...")
    with torch.no_grad():
        output = model(x, mask=mask)

    # Print output shape and statistics
    logger.info(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
    logger.info(f"Output mean: {output.mean().item():.4f}")
    logger.info(f"Output std: {output.std().item():.4f}")

    return output


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        output = main()
        logger.success("Successfully ran MambaMoE forward pass!")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception(f"Error running MambaMoE: {str(e)}")
        raise

```

## Architecture Overview

The architecture consists of alternating Mamba blocks and Mixture of Experts feed-forward networks (MoE FFN), allowing for efficient sequence processing while maintaining model capacity through specialized expert networks.
